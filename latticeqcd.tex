\chapter{Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics}
\label{chap:latticeqcd}

As discussed in sec. \ref{sec:qcd}, at low energies ($\sim$200MeV and below), QCD becomes non-perturbative. In other words, the coupling $\alpha_s$ becomes $\mathcal{O}(1)$, and an expansion in $\alpha_s$ (as in perturbation theory) will not be dominated by the leading orders. In order to calculate observables of low energy QCD (like hadronic form factors), we require an alternative to perturbation theory.

The expectation value of an observable $\mathcal{O}$ in a Yang-Mills theory can be expressed as a path integral;
\begin{align}
 \langle \mathcal{O} \rangle = {1\over Z}\int [dG d\psi d\bar{\psi}] \, \mathcal{O} \, e^{iS[G,\psi,\bar{\psi}]},
\end{align}
where $A$ is a gauge field, $\psi$($\bar{\psi}$) is an (anti)fermion field, $S$ is the classical action, and $[dG d\psi d\bar{\psi}]$ denotes integration over all configurations of the gauge and fermion fields. $Z = \langle 1 \rangle$ is the partition function. In the perturbative approach, we would expand $\exp(-\text{interacting part of }S )$ resulting in a power series in the gauge coupling populated by Feynman diagrams.

The other option is to instead carry out the integral directly, by numerical brute force. Since it is not numerically feasible to carry out an infinite number of integrals, one must approximate spacetime as a discrete 4 dimensional lattice with spacing "$a$" between lattice sites, finite spacial volume $L_x^3$ and finite temporal extent $L_t$. The functional integral becomes
\begin{align}
 \int [dG d\psi d\bar{\psi}] \to \prod_{n} \int dU(x_n) d\psi(x_n) d\bar{\psi}(x_n),
\end{align}
where $n$ is a 4-vector with integer components labelling the sites, and $x_n^{\mu} = an^{\mu}$.
This has a second benefit which is to naturally regularize the theory with a momentum cutoff $\Lambda \sim 1/a$. The gauge field has been replaced with the {\it{gauge link}} $U$, to be defined in the following section.

To avoid having to integrate over imaginary numbers (more specifically to avoid the scourge of the {\it{sign problem}} \cite{deForcrand:2010ys}), one also performs a {\it{Wick rotation}}. This is the redefinition $t\to it$, which changes the metric from Minkowski to Euclidean, and changes the weight $\exp{iS} \to \exp{-S}$. This has the advantage that it turns the quantum path integral into simply an average in statistical mechanics, this means we can apply all of the machenery of statistical mechanics to computing expectation values.

To obtain the 'real world' result for some expectation value, where the real world means $a=0$, one must perform the path integral at a number of different $a$ values, and then extrapolate the results to $a=0$.

One must choose a discretized version of the QCD action $S$, one which becomes continuum QCD in the continuum ($a\to 0$) limit. This is a far from trivial step. There are an infinite number of choices of lattice actions that become QCD in the continuum limit. There therefore is a huge literature of different choices of discrete lattice actions. Different collaborations use different actions, and there is never-ending argument about the merits and pitfalls of each.

The rest of this chapter is dedicated to motivating and detailing the choices of discretisation used in the work of this thesis.

\section{Lattice Gauge Fields}
\label{sec:gaugefields}

Often the best way to introduce some sophisticated method or technique is to first show how the naive approach breaks down. Imagine attempting a naive discretisation of the QCD action. Derivatives can be replaced with something like
\begin{align}
  \partial_{\mu}f(x) \to {1\over 2a} \left( f(x+a\hat{\mu}) - f(x-a\hat{\mu}) \right)
\end{align}
where $\hat{\mu}$ is the unit vector in the $\mu$ direction. The quark kinetic part of the QCD action, $\bar{q}\slashed{D}q$, becomes
\begin{align}
  {1\over 2a} \bar{q}(x)\gamma^{\mu}q(x+a\hat{\mu}) - {1\over 2a} \bar{q}(x)\gamma^{\mu}q(x-a\hat{\mu}) - ig\bar{q}(x)G_{\mu}(x)\gamma^{\mu} q(x).
\end{align}
This is no longer invariant under the gauge trasforms \eqref{eq:quark_gauge_trans}, for example the first term becomes $\bar{q}(x)\Lambda(x)^{\dagger} \Lambda(x+a\hat{\mu}) (x+a\hat{\mu})$. The finite difference between lattice sites force us to think more carefully about the interpretation of gauge symmetry on a lattice.

Formally speaking, a gauge feild is a connection on a fibre bundle. We will flesh out what this means.

At each point $x$, there is a space of possible vectors that a quark filed $q(x)$ could be, call it $V_x$ In this case, this is the colour space, the space of colour vectors (this refers to a single flavour, we suppress the flavour index here for breifity). These spaces are called {\it{fibres}}. Spacetime, in our case $\mathbb{E}^4$, is called the {\it{base space}} in this context.

The problem with our non-gauge-invariant terms above is that we are trying to compare vectors in different fibres. To compare colour vectors at two different spacetime points, i.e. two different fibres, one must {\it{parallel transport}} the vector from one point to annother, according to some rule of how it changes, the so-called {\it{connection}}. In our case the parallel transport is a Wilson line:
\begin{align}
\nonumber  &W(x,y) : V_y \to V_x \\ &W(x,y) = Pe^{ig\int dc\cdot G }
\end{align}
where $c$ is some curve between $x$ and $y$, and $P$ orders the operation of the gauge field $G$ on the fibres, i.e. the $G$. A wilson line transoforms under the gauge group like $W(x,y)\to \Lambda(x)W(x,y)\Lambda^{\dagger}(y)$, so operators like $\bar{q}(x)W(x,y)q(y)$ are gauge-invariant, reflecting the fact that the color vector $q(y)$ has been parallel transported into the same fibre as $\bar{q}(x)$.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \vspace{-10pt}
    \includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth]{images/fibres.jpg}
    \caption{Depiction of colour spaces (fibres) at two points in spactime (base space) with the value of the quark field $q$ represented at each point as a colour vector, and the connection $W(x,y)$ needed to compare the two colour vectors. A gauge transform changes the two vectors in different ways, for the comparison to be gauge independent, the connection must also transform appropriately.}
  \end{center}
  \vspace{-10pt}
\end{figure}

From this we see that, on a lattice, the natural degrees of freedom are no longer the elements of the Lie algebra, $G_{\mu}$, but Wilson lines connecting adjacent lattice sites, also known as {\it{links}}:
\begin{align}
  U_{\mu}(x) : V_x \to V_{x+a\hat{\mu}},\,\,\in SU(N_c)
\end{align}
that Gauge transform like
\begin{align}
  U_{\mu}(x) \to \Lambda(x) U_{\mu}(x) \Lambda^{\dagger}(x+a\hat{\mu}).
\end{align}
Then, a bilinear of colour vectors at any two points can be made to be gauge invariant by including a path between them made of links. For example;
\begin{align}
  \nonumber
  \bar{q}(x)U_{\mu}(x)q(x+a\hat{\mu}) \quad \to\quad &[\bar{q}(x)\Lambda^{\dagger}(x)](\Lambda(x) U_{\mu}(x) \Lambda^{\dagger}(x+a\hat{\mu})) [\Lambda(x+a\hat{\mu})q(x+a\hat{\mu})]
  \\
  &= \bar{q}(x)U_{\mu}(x)q(x+a\hat{\mu}).
  %% \bar{q}(x)U_{\mu}(x)U_{\nu}(x+a\hat{\mu})q(x+a\hat{\mu}+a\hat{\nu}) \to&
  %% \bar{q}(x)\Lambda^{\dagger}(x) \\ \nonumber
  %% &(\Lambda(x) U_{\mu}(x) \Lambda^{\dagger}(x+a\hat{\mu})) \\ \nonumber
  %% &(\Lambda(x+a\hat{\mu}) U_{\mu}(x+a\hat{\mu}) \Lambda^{\dagger}(x+a\hat{\mu}+a\hat{\nu})) \\ \nonumber
  %% &\Lambda(x+a\hat{\mu}+a\hat{\nu}) q(x+a\hat{\mu}) \\ \nonumber
  %% &= \bar{q}(x)U_{\mu}(x)U_{\nu}(x+a\hat{\mu})q(x+a\hat{\mu}+a\hat{\nu}).
\end{align}

\begin{figure}

    \caption{Depiction of a gauge invariant quark bilinear, connected by a Wilson line made of gauge links.}
  \end{center}
  \vspace{-10pt}
\end{figure}

The $\bar{q}\slashed{D}q$ term in the QCD Lagrangian can then be represented on the lattice in a Gauge invariant way by
\begin{align}
  {1\over 2a}\bar{q}(x) \gamma_{\mu}(U_{\mu}(x)q(x+a\hat{\mu}) + U^{\dagger}_{\mu}(x-a\hat{\mu})q(x-a\hat{\mu}) )
  \label{eq:latticederivative}
\end{align}
If one defines the links in terms of the the continuum gauge fields $G_{\mu}$ via
\begin{align}
  U_{\mu}(x) = \exp\left( iga G_{\mu}\left(x+{a\hat{\mu}\over2}\right) \right),
\end{align}
then \eqref{eq:latticederivative} takes the correct form in the continuum limit, i.e. it becomes $\bar{q}\slashed{D}q + \order{a^2}$.

\subsection{The Gauge Action}

We must design a pure gauge part of the action in terms of link variables. It is clear that the only pure-gauge operators, operators depending only on the link variables, are closed loops of links, as in fig. \ref{fig:plaquette}.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \vspace{-10pt}
    \includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth]{images/plaquette.jpg}
    \caption{Elementary Plaquette. \label{fig:plaquette}}
    \vspace{-20pt}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

This brings us basically all the way to the correct answer. The simplest lattice discretisation of the Yang-Mills action is the real part of the smallest possible closed loop of gauge links;
\begin{align}
  S_G = - &{1\over g^2} \sum_x \sum_{\mu\neq \nu} \text{Re Tr} (1-\Box_{\mu\nu}(x)), \\
  &\Box_{\mu\nu} = U_{\mu}(x)U_{\nu}(x+a\hat{\mu}) U^{\dagger}_{\mu}(x+a\hat{\nu}) U^{\dagger}_{\nu}(x).
  \label{eq:wilson_gauge_action}
\end{align}
$\Box_{\mu\nu}$ is called the {\it{elementary plaquette}}. In the continuum limit this action reduces to
\begin{align}
  S_G = {1\over 4} \int d^4x \text{Tr}G_{\mu\nu}G^{\mu\nu} + \order{a^2}
\end{align}
as required.

This lattice action has a sensible interpretation in terms of the geometrical interpretation of gauge theory. The gauge force is due to {\it{curvature}} in the gauge field, which is esentially a path-dependence in parallel transport. If the parallel transport of a colour vector between $x$ and $y$ was dependent on the path taken between $x$ and $y$, this is said to be the presence of curvature. The gauge force is due to the presence of curvature, and the simplest local measure of the curvature is the plaquette.

In fact, any closed loop reduces to the Yang-Mills action in the continuum. This can be seen intuatively, taking the continuum limit means shrinking any closed loop into an infinitesimally small point. We then have a choice of gauge action on the lattice.

\subsection{Symmanzik Improvements of the Gauge Action}

As mentioned in the last section, any lattice action is admissable for a calculation as long as it reduces to the appropriate QCD action in the continuum. This gives us a lot of freedom in how we chose our lattice action. A pure gauge action can be any combination of closed Wilson loops.

This freedom can be exploited in order to push observables on the lattice closer to their continuum values (reduce the 'discretisation effects'), such that if one needed to perform an extrapolation of some expectation value to continuum, the extrapolation would be better controlled. This program is known as {\it{Symmanzik improvement}}.

In general, a sensible lattice action looks like
\begin{align}
  S = \sum_{i} c_i(g) \mathcal{O}^i_{\text{lat}} = z_0(\{c_i\}) S_{\text{cont}} + a^2 \sum_{n=1} z_n(\{c_i\}) S_n
  \label{eq:continuum_limit_action}
\end{align}
where $S_{\text{cont}}$ is the continuum action. We are free to choose any $\{c_i\}$ such that $z_0(\{c_i\}) = 1$. In every example we are concerned with $\order{a}$ terms are absent, hence we have ignored that possibility here. A fundemental postulate of the Symmanzik approach is that improvement (removal of discretisation effects) of one observable results in improvement of all other observables. With this in mind, a reasonable approach is:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Choose some set of lattice operators $\{\mathcal{O}^i_{\text{lat}}\}$. The number of operators required can be deduced by looking at the number of allowed irrelevant operators in the continuum theory at the mass dimension of the order of $a$ you want to remove, i.e. the number of $S_n$ operators in \eqref{eq:continuum_limit_action}.
\item
  Inspect continuum limit of lattice action to find $z_0(\{c_i\})$, enforce $z_0(\{c_i\})=1$.
\item
  Choose some observable $\mathcal{O}$ that can be calculated in both the lattice and continuum theory. Use the remaining freedom in $\{c_i\}$ to remove the leading $a$ dependence in $\langle \mathcal{O}\rangle$ order by order in perturbation theory. i.e., if we write the expectation value as
  \begin{align}
    \langle \mathcal{O} \rangle = \sum_{n,m} a^{2n} g^{2m}\langle \mathcal{O}_{n,m}(\{c_i\}) \rangle,
  \end{align}
then this amounts to demanding that $\langle \mathcal{O}_{1,m}(\{c_i\})\rangle = 0$, for as many $m$'s as possible.
\end{itemize}

Applying this to pure QCD, this procedure results in the L\"uscher-Weitz action \cite{luscher1985}, we will outline the process here. First consider the number of operators required. In continuum pure QCD, the only dimension 4 operator is Tr$G_{\mu\nu}G^{\mu\nu}$. There are no dimension 5 operators, hence there can be no $\order{a}$ contribution to the continuum limit of a lattice action. There are three independent dimension 6 operators:
\begin{align}
  \nonumber
  &S_1 = \text{Tr} J_{\mu\nu\rho} J_{\mu\nu\rho} \\
  \nonumber
  &S_2 = \text{Tr} J_{\mu\mu\rho} J_{\nu\nu\rho} \quad\quad J_{\mu\nu\rho} = [ D_{\mu}, G_{\nu\rho} ] \\
  &S_3 = \text{Tr} J_{\mu\mu\nu} J_{\mu\mu\nu}
\end{align}
Hence we require 3 extra operators in the lattice action to be tuned in order to remove the three contributions from the $a^2$ terms in \eqref{eq:continuum_limit_action}. The simplest choice is to take the plaquette action \eqref{eq:wilson_gauge_action}, and add all possible Wilson loops contanining 6 links. This set consists of three families related by hypercubic invariance, {\it{rectangles}} (a), {\it{parallelograms}} (b) and {\it{chairs}} (c), depicted in fig. \ref{fig:LuscherWeitz}.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \vspace{-10pt}
    \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{images/LuscherWeitz.jpg}
    \vspace{-10pt}
    \caption{Terms additional to the elementary plaquette in the improved pure QCD action. \label{fig:LuscherWeitz}}
    \vspace{-10pt}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

So the new lattice action is
\begin{align}
  S_G =& - {1\over g^2} \sum_x \sum_{\mu\neq \nu}(\quad c_0(g) \text{Re Tr} (1-\Box_{\mu\nu}(x)) + c_1(g) \,\text{Re Tr} (1 - \Box^a_{\mu\nu}(x)) \\
  & + \sum_{\rho\neq \mu,\nu}( \,c_2(g)\, \text{Re Tr} (1 - \Box^b_{\mu\nu\rho}(x)) + c_3(g) \, \text{Re Tr} (1 - \Box^c_{\mu\nu\rho}(x))\quad)\quad)
\end{align}
where $\Box^{a,b,c}_{\mu\nu(\rho)}$ are the Wilson loops in fig. \ref{fig:LuscherWeitz}. Expanding this in small $a$, one finds the function $z_0(\{c_i\})$, setting this to one we find the condition \cite{WEISZ19831};
\begin{align}
  c_0 + 8 (c_1 + c_2) + 16 c_3 = 1.
\end{align}
The rest of the freedom must be fixed by comparing observables in the lattice and continuum theories. In \cite{WEISZ1984397} for example, by matching the gluon propagator between the two theories, one constrains the coefficients further (at tree level)
\begin{align}
  c_1 = -{1\over 12} \quad,\quad
  c_0 - 8c_3 = {5\over 3}
\end{align}
These are classical relations, so will only prevent lattice artifacts up to $\order{\alpha_s}$. For better improvement, one must compare observables that are sensitive to loop corrections. A popular choice of observable is the so-called static quark potential $V(L)$. This is the potential energy between two static colour charges, as a function of separation $aL$ between them. It can be related to the expectation value of a rectangular Wilson loop $\Box(L,T)$, extending in one spacial direction by $L$ links and in the time direction by $T$ links. In the $T\to \infty$ limit, this can be written as
\begin{align}
  \langle \text{Re Tr} \Box(L,T) \rangle \propto \int [d\psi d\bar{\psi} dU] e^{-\sum_x \mathcal{L} + igaA_0 \delta_{{\textbf{x}},{\textbf{x}}_0}  - igaA_0 \delta_{{\textbf{x}},{\textbf{x}}_1} }
\end{align}
where $\textbf{x}_0$, $\textbf{x}_1$ are two spacial indices $L$ links apart. This can be interpreted as the partition function $Z$ in the presence of two (oppositely charged) static colour charges at $\textbf{x}_1$ and $\textbf{x}_2$. From statistical mechanics, the partition function is related to the internal energy of the system via $E = -{1\over T} \ln Z$. This motivates the expression for the static quark potential:
\begin{align}
  V(L) = - \lim_{T\to \infty} {1\over T} \ln \left( {1\over N} \langle \text{Re Tr} \Box(L,T) \rangle \right),
\end{align}
where $aN$ is the spacial extent of the lattice. To constrain $\{c_i\}$, one evaluates this order by order in perturbation theory from the continuum and lattice theories, this amounts to comparing $w_n(L,T)$ from the two theories where this is defined by
\begin{align}
  - \ln \left( {1\over N} \langle \text{Re Tr} \Box(L,T) \rangle \right) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} { g_0^{2n} \over (2n)! } w_n(L,T).
\end{align}

This procedure is effected by the presence of fermions, so it has been performed a number of times to accomodate different fermion discretisations. In this thesis we report results using the L\"uscher-Weitz action for gauge fields and HISQ fermions (see sec. \ref{sec:fermions}). In this context, the coefficients $\{c_i\}$ were fixed at one-loop via $w_1(L,T)$ in \cite{Hart:2008sq}, to be
\begin{align}
  c_0& = {5\over 3} + ( \,0.237088(46) - 0.1008(34) N_f \,) \alpha_s + \order{\alpha_s^2}\\
  c_1& = -{1\over 12} + ( \,-0.025218(4) + 0.0110(3) N_f \,) \alpha_s + \order{\alpha_s^2}\\
  c_2& = 0 + ( \,-0.025218(4) + 0.0110(3) N_f \,) \alpha_s + \order{\alpha_s^2} \\
  c_3& = 0
\end{align}
since these have been tuned to remove $a^2$ effects up to $\alpha_s$, lattice artifacts in observables computed using this action will be of size $\order{a^2\alpha_s^2}$, so we say this action is $\order{a^2\alpha_s}$-improved.

\section{Lattice Fermions}
\label{sec:fermions}

Putting fermions on the lattice supply a much larger host of complications than gauge fields do. There exist a diverse array of approaches to dealing with fermions on the lattice adopted by different collaborations. Different actions are suited to different types of applications, and intense debates have taken place over the years about the theoretical grounding of various actions. The plethora of fermion actions is due mostly to the famous doubling problem, which we will describe below.

In this chapter we will focus only on the fermion actions used in this work; namely the Highly Improved Staggered Quark (HISQ) action, and the Non-Relativistic QCD (NRQCD) action.

Before beginning the discussion of fermion discretisations, we will define some common notation used for gamma matrcies in this context. We are interested in studying theories in Euclidean space, so we will use euclidean gamma matrices, obeying
\begin{align}
  \{\gamma_{\mu},\gamma_{\nu}\} = 2\delta_{\mu\nu}.
\end{align}
These have the useful property $\gamma_{\mu}^2=1$. The full set of spin-mixing matrices can be labelled according to
\begin{align}
  \gamma_n = \prod_{\mu} \left( \gamma_{\mu} \right)^{n_{\mu}} \quad n_{\mu} = \mathbb{Z}_2
\end{align}
There are 16 such matrices representing corners of the hypercube. One can also use a general site vector $x_{\mu}$ to label the matrix, then $\gamma_x = \gamma_n$ where $n_{\mu} = x_{\mu}/a \mod 2$. One can show that for any $n$; $\gamma_n^{\dagger} \gamma_n = 1$. We also define $\gamma_{5\mu} = i\gamma_5\gamma_{\mu}$, and $\gamma_{5n} = \prod_{\mu}(\gamma_{5\mu})^n$.

\subsection{The Naive Fermion Action \& The Doubling Problem}

The interacting Dirac action is most naively discretised with
\begin{align}
 S_F &= \sum_{x,\mu} \bar{\psi}(x) \gamma_{\mu} \nabla_{\mu} \psi(x) + m\sum_x \bar{\psi}(x) \psi(x),
 \label{eq:naivefermions}
\end{align}
where $\nabla_{\mu}$ is the gauge covariant finite difference operator,
\begin{align}	
	\nabla_{\mu} \psi(x) = {1\over 2a} \left( U_{\mu} (x) \psi(x+a\hat{\mu}) - U^{\dagger}_{\mu}(x-a\hat{\mu})\psi(x-a\hat{\mu}) \right).
\label{eq:lat_derivative}
\end{align}
%% In appendix \ref{sec:doublingprob} we describe the doubling problem. This is the observation that the propagator for a fermion obeying \eqref{eq:naivefermions}, $M^{-1}(k)$ has the property
%% \begin{align}
%% 	M^{-1}(k+{\pi\over a}\zeta) = \gamma_{5\mu} M^{-1}(k) \gamma_{5\mu}
%% \end{align}
%% For 16 4-vectors $\zeta_{\mu} \in \mathbb{Z}_2$. This leads to 16 poles in the fermion specturm, therefore 16 distinct excitations (called \textit{tastes}). We require a way of removing the 15 unphysical excitations.

$S_F$ is invariant under a so-called ``doubling symmetry'', which is generated by
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:doublingsymmetry}
  \psi(x) & \to \mathcal{B}_{\mu} \psi(x) \equiv  (-1)^{x_{\mu}/a} \gamma_{5\mu} \psi(x) \\
  \bar{\psi}(x) & \to \bar{\psi(x)}\mathcal{B}^{\dagger}_{\mu} \equiv (-1)^{x_{\mu}/a} \bar{\psi}(x) \gamma^{\dagger}_{5\mu}.
\end{align}
The product space of these form a group of 16 elements $\{\mathcal{B}_{\zeta}\}$, labeled by vectors $\zeta$ with $\zeta_{\mu}\in \mathbb{Z}_2$ (e.g.the element $\mathcal{B}_{0}\mathcal{B}_{1}$ is labeled by $\zeta=(1,1,0,0)$).

The physical signifiance of this symmetry can be seen when we study it's effect on the action. First, notice that
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{B}_{\mu} \psi(x) & = \gamma_{5\mu} \sum_k \tilde{\psi}(k) e^{i(k+{\pi\over a}\hat{\mu})\cdot x} \\
  & = \gamma_{5\mu} \sum_k \tilde{\psi}(k-{\pi\over a}\hat{\mu})e^{ik\cdot x},
\end{align}
where $\{k\}$ is a discrete set of 4-momenta, with $k_{\mu}$ values spaced by $\pi/aN_{\mu}$ ($N_{\mu}=$number of sites is direction $\mu$) and truncated at $\pi/a$, due to finite size and finite lattice spacing. The action in momentum space can be written as
\begin{align}
  S = \sum_k \bar{\tilde{\psi}}(k) M(k) \tilde{\psi}(k).
\end{align}
After the operation of $\mathcal{B}_{\mu}$ it becomes
\begin{align}
  S \to \sum_k \bar{\tilde{\psi}}(k) \gamma_{5\mu} M(k+{\pi\over a}\hat{\mu})\gamma_{5\mu} \tilde{\psi}(k)
\end{align}
Since we know $S$ is invariant under this transformation, it must be true that $\gamma_{5\mu} M(k+{\pi\over a}\hat{\mu})\gamma_{5\mu} = M(k)$, and therefore
\begin{align}
  M^{-1}(k+{\pi\over a}\hat{\mu}) = \gamma_{5\mu} M^{-1}(k) \gamma_{5\mu}
  \label{eq:doubling}
\end{align}
$M^{-1}$ is the momentum space propagator for the fermion field, so \ref{eq:doubling} shows that the spectrum of the fermion is periodic, with a period of $\pi/a$. We expect a pole in $M^{-1}(k)$ where $k \sim m$, where $m$ is the pole mass of the fermion, but there will now be a second pole at $m + \pi/a$. This will be around the natural cutoff imposed by the lattice $1/a$, and any higher poles like $m+2\pi/a$ is far above the cutoff so will not contribute.

Generalizing this argument to all elements of the doubling symmetry, we see that
\begin{align}
  M^{-1}(k+{\pi\over a}\zeta) = \gamma_{5\zeta} M^{-1}(k) \gamma_{5\zeta}.
\end{align}
This leads to 16 poles in the fermion specturm, one for each $zeta$ choice, therefore 16 distinct excitations (called \textit{tastes}).

One can isolate a single taste by a block-scaling procedure;
\begin{align}
  \psi^{(\zeta)}(x_B) = {1\over 16} \sum_{\delta x_{\mu} \in \mathbb{Z}_2} \mathcal{B}_{\zeta}(x_B + \delta x) \psi(x_B + \delta x).
  \label{eq:block-scaling}
\end{align}
For example, for $\zeta = 0$, it would only contain the original non-doubler taste, since all other poles at $|k|\sim\pi/a$ have been integrated out. For $\zeta \neq 0$, the $\mathcal{B}_{\zeta}$ operator pushes the $\zeta$ doubler to where the $\zeta=0$ taste originally was in $k$ space, then the blocking procedure integrates out the rest.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Staggered Quarks}

There are a number of solutions to this problem. The most straightforward is to modify the action to push the mass of the unwanted tastes above the momentum cutoff, preventing it from influencing the dynamics, these are called \textit{Wilson-type fermions} \cite{Wilson:1974sk}. However, actions of this type explicity break Chiral symmetry. Among other issues, this causes additive renormalization of the fermion mass, immensely complicating renormalization procedures.

Annother approach, known as \textit{staggered fermions} \cite{Kogut:1974ag}, partially resolves the doubling issue while retaining chiral symmetry ({\red{?}}). The work presented in this thesis makes extensive use of the staggered formalism.
%Other notable approaches besides Wilson and staggered quarks include \textit{domain wall} \cite{Jansen:1994ym} and \textit{overlap} \cite{Narayanan:2011qj} fermions.

Staggered fermions are defined via the following. Redefine the fields according to
\begin{align}
 \psi(x) = \gamma_x \chi(x).
 \label{eq:staggered}
\end{align}
In terms of the new spinor variables $\chi(x)$, the naive action \eqref{eq:naivefermions} becomes
\begin{align}
  S_F &= \bar{\chi}(x)[\alpha_{\mu}(x) \nabla_{\mu} + m ] \chi(x)
\end{align}
where $\alpha_{\mu}(x) = (-1)^{\sum_{\nu < \mu} x^{\mu}/a}$. The action is now diagonal in spin, leading to 4 decoupled grassman variables with identicle actions and identicle coupling to the gauge field. As a result, $\chi$ propagators (on fixed gauge backgrounds) are spin diagonal:
\begin{align}
	M^{-1}_{\chi}(x,y)[U] = g(x,y)[U] \,\, 1_{\text{spin}},
\end{align}
where $g(x,y)$ is a singlet under spin. One need only to include a single component of $\chi$ in a simulation (i.e. fix $\chi = (\chi_1,0,0,0)$). Then they can compute $M^{-1}_{\chi}(x,y)[U]$ to obtain $g(x,y)$. Then, using the inverse of \eqref{eq:staggered}, $g(x,y)$ can be transformed to a propagator of the original spinors:
\begin{align}
	M_{\psi}^{-1}(x,y)[U] = g(x,y)[U] \,\,\gamma_x \gamma^{\dagger}_y.
\end{align}
This is clearly computationally beneficial. But also, by shaving off the other spinor components, one reduces the number propagating degrees of freedom by a factor of 4, cutting the number of tastes from 16 down to 4.

We can show more explicitly how this happens. To do this, consider rewriting an isolated taste \eqref{eq:block-scaling} in the staggered formalism, i.e., in terms of $\chi$;
\begin{align}
  \psi^{(\zeta)}(x_B) = {1\over 16} \sum_{\delta x_{\mu} \in \mathbb{Z}_2} \gamma_{\delta x} \mathcal{B}_{\zeta}(0) \chi(x+\delta x).
\end{align}
Recall we set $\chi(x) = (\chi_1(x),0,0,0)$. The product $\gamma_{\delta x} \mathcal{B}_{\zeta}(0)$ is simply a product of gamma matrices, so can only serve to ``scramble'' the elements of $\chi$. Then, in the staggered formalism, all 16 tastes $\psi^{(\zeta)}$ amount to only 4 distinguishable fermions: $(\chi_1,0,0,0)$, $(0,\chi_1,0,0)$, $(0,0,\chi_1,0)$, $(0,0,0,\chi_1)$ (with factors of (-1) and $i$).

In practice in lattice calculations, the remaining multipilcity is tacked in 3 steps:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item
	Ensure only one taste is created and destroyed in the propagator.
	\item
	Minimize the interaction between tastes by a modification of the action.
	\item
	Remove contributions of extra tastes in the sea by taking det$M \to \sqrt[4]{\text{det}M}$ (the context required to understand this step is eludicated in chapter \ref{chap:latticecalculations}).
\end{enumerate}
The third step is the main source of objection to using the staggered formalism for lattice calculations. We will breifly explain this contention in chapter \ref{chap:latticecalculations}.

%% Step 3 can be justified by the following - in the $a\to 0$ limit, det$M$ tends to (det$M^{(0)})^4$, where $M^{(0)}$ is the Dirac oprator for a single taste. Then, taking the 4th root (in principle) reduces the determinant to that of a sea containing 1 taste.

\subsection{Highly Improved Staggered Quarks}

  \end{center}
  \vspace{-30pt}
  \caption{Taste mixing at tree level.}
  \label{fig:tastemixing}
\end{figure}

Step 2 above is the guiding principle for the action we in much of this work, the Highly Improved Staggered Quark action (HISQ) \cite{Follana:2006rc}. 

Interaction between different tastes ("taste mixing") is dominated by the process in fig. \ref{fig:tastemixing}, the exchange of single gluons carrying momenta close to $\zeta \pi/a$. In HISQ, this is suppressed by modifying the gauge fields in such a way as to minimize the coupling between a gluon with momentum ${\zeta\pi/a}$ and the fermions, in other words, minimize the vertices in fig. \ref{fig:tastemixing}.

To this end, one can change the action so that fermions only couple to {\textit{smeared}} gauge links, in which high frequency exitations have been removed. Define the first and second covariant derivative operators;
\begin{align}
	\nonumber
	\delta_{\rho}U_{\mu}(x) & \equiv {1\over a} \big( U_{\rho} (x) U_{\mu} (x + a\hat{\rho}) U_{\rho}^{\dagger}(x+a\hat{\mu}) \\
	& - U_{\rho}^{\dagger}(x-a\hat{\rho})U_{\mu}(x-a\hat{\rho})U_{\rho}(x-a\hat{\rho}+a\hat{\mu})\big)  \\
	\nonumber
	\delta_{\rho}^{(2)} U_{\mu}(x) & \equiv {1\over a^2} \big( U_{\rho}(x+a\hat{\rho})U^{\dagger}_{\rho}(x+a\hat{\mu}) \\
	\nonumber	
	& - 2U_{\mu}(x) \\
	& + U_{\rho}^{\dagger}(x-a\hat{\rho})U_{\mu}(x-a\hat{\rho})U_{\rho}(x - a\hat{\rho} + a\hat{\mu}) \big).
\end{align}
With this we can define the smearing operator;
\begin{align}
	\mathcal{F}_{\mu} = \prod_{\rho\neq\mu} \left( 1 + {a^2 \delta^{(2)}_{\rho}\over 4} \right)
\end{align}
HISQ uses two different smeared gauge fields defined by
\begin{align}
	X_{\mu}(x) &\equiv \mathcal{U} \mathcal{F}_{\mu} U_{\mu}(x), \\
	W_{\mu}(x) &\equiv \left(\mathcal{F}_{\mu} - \sum_{\rho\neq\mu}{a^2(\delta_{\rho})^2\over 2} \right) \mathcal{U} \mathcal{F}_{\mu} U_{\mu}(x).
	\label{eq:gaugesmearing}
\end{align}
where $\mathcal{U}$ is a re-unitarization operator, that acts on a matrix $A$ like $\mathcal{U}A = A/\sqrt{A^{\dagger}A}$. The HISQ action can then be written as:
\begin{align}
	S_{\text{HISQ}} = \sum_{x} \bar{\psi}(x) \left( \gamma_{\mu} \left( \nabla_{\mu}(W) - {a^2\over 6}(1+\epsilon_{\text{Naik}})\nabla^3_{\mu}(X) \right) + m \right) \psi(x)
\end{align}
Where $\nabla_{\mu}(Z)$ is the covariant derivative \eqref{eq:lat_derivative} with gauge links repaced with $Z$. This action in fact not only removes tree level interactions like fig. \ref{fig:tastemixing}, but also all taste mixing interactions at 1-loop.

The $\nabla^3_{\mu}$ term is a Symmanzik improvement, it reduces the size of discretisation effects of observables computed using this action. The value of $\epsilon_{\text{Naik}}$ is fixed according to the constraint
\begin{align}
	\lim_{\underline{p}\to 0} {E^2(\underline{p})-m^2\over \underline{p}^2} = 1.
\end{align}
where $E(\underline{p})$ obeys the tree-level dispersion relation from the HISQ action. Tuning $\epsilon_{\text{Naik}}$ according to this constraint gives us the expression
\begin{align}
  \epsilon_{\text{Naik}} = \,&{ 4 - \sqrt{ 4 + 12 {m_{\text{tree}}\over \cosh(m_{\text{tree}}) \sinh(m_{\text{tree}})} } \over \sinh^2(m_{\text{tree}}) - 1 }, \\
  \nonumber
  m_{\text{tree}} &= m\Big( 1 - {3\over 80}m^4 + {23\over 2240}m^6 + {1783\over 537600 }m^8 \\ &- {76943\over 23654400} m^{10} \Big) + \order{m^{12}}. \nonumber
\end{align}

\section{Heavy Quarks on the Lattice}

The range of different quark masses in nature present a number of further complications to lattice calculations. $u$ and $d$ quarks cause huge problems due to how light they are, this will be addressed in chapter \ref{chap:latticecalculations}. $s$ quarks are easy.

As quarks get heavier, we begin to encounter another problem. Discretisation effects will generally grow like the largest scale in the theory. If the observable being computed on the lattice is sensitive to the dynamics of a heavy quark of mass $m_h$, this will contain discretisation effects of size $(am_h)^n$ (where $n$ depends on how improved the action is). This is essentially due to the de Broglie wavelength of the heavy quark excitations being close to the lattice spacing, the excitations 'hide' in-between lattice sites.

How heavy we can go is limited to two factors: the improvement of the lattice action and the lattice spacing. How fine we can get the lattice spacing is limited by computational cost. The physical size of the lattice must always be at least large enough to fit the lightest degrees of freedom in the system, namely it must be larger than the wavelength of pions. This means to get smaller lattice spacing requires increasing the number of sites on the lattice, hence increasing the computational costs (details in chapter \ref{chap:latticecalculations}).

  \caption{Different scales relevent to non-perturbative physics, and brackets showing the range of scales that typical lattices can resolve. The larger the range of scales resolved, the more computationally expensive the calculation.}
\end{figure}

In the past, $c$ quarks resulted in uncontrollable discretisation effects, but now armed with highly improved actions like HISQ, and very fine lattices, $c$ physics has been conquered on the lattice \cite{Davies:2008nq,Davies:2008hs,Koponen:2011ev,Na:2011mc,Na:2012uh,Na:2012iu,Koponen:2013ila}. 

The mass of the $b$ is still somewhat out of reach. Even with the HISQ action and the finest lattices avaliable with current computational constraints, physical $b$ quarks will create uncontrollable discretisation effects.

The work in this thesis concerns the decays of mesons contaning $b$ quarks. We approach the issue of the heavy $b$ in two different ways, the {\it{heavy-HISQ}} approach, and the {\it{Lattice NRQCD}} action. Since the main results of this thesis results from our heavy-HISQ studies, we will not go into too much detail in describing lattice NRQCD.

\subsection{Heavy HISQ}

The heavy-HISQ approach is essentially to model the $b$ with the HISQ action, but to perform the calculation at a number of unphysically light $b$ masses (that we usually refer to generically as heavy $h$ quarks), and extrapolate the results to the physical $b$ mass. Typically the $h$ masses span most of the region between the $c$ mass and the $b$ mass.

Luckily there exists an effective field theory for understanding how to perform such an extrapolation - HQET. HQET gives a framework to describe how observables depend on masses of heavy quarks, so one can use HQET to derive fit forms of such an extrapolation.

\begin{figure}

      0.55\textwidth]{images/fetah_heavyhisq.png}

  \vspace{-5pt}
  \caption{An extrapolation to $m_h=m_b$ of the $\eta_h$ decay constant (where $\eta_h$ is a pseudoscalar $\bar{h}h$ meson \cite{McNeile:2012qf}. The colourful points are measurements of $f_{\eta_h}$ on the lattice, the colour denotes lattice spacing and the $x$ axis, $M_{\eta_h}$, is a proxy for the $h$-quark mass.}
\end{figure}

The heavy-HISQ approach is a reasonably new program. It has so far been used for computing $b$ decay constants and masses \cite{McNeile:2012qf}, and a number of heavy-HISQ calculations of semileptonic form factors are currently underway. The work presented in chapters \ref{chap:BsDsstar} and \ref{chap:BsDs} adopt the heavy-HISQ approach. Besides these, there are also calculations of form factors for the $B_c\to \eta_cl\nu$, $B_c\to J/\psi l\nu$ \cite{Lytle:2016ixw}, $B_c\to B_sl\nu$, $B_s\to \eta_sl\nu$, and $B\to D^*l\nu$ decays.

\subsection{Lattice NRQCD}

The root of the problem of heavy quarks on the lattice is in the rest mass of the quark. Consider the expansion in momentum $\textbf{p}^2$ of the continuum relativistic dispersion relation:
\begin{align}
  \omega = \sqrt{{\textbf{p}}^2 + m^2} \simeq m + {{\textbf{p}}^2\over 2m} - {{\textbf{p}}^4\over 4m^3} + ...
  \label{eq:rel_expansion}
\end{align}
the first term (rest mass) is the source of the issue, when $m > 1/a$ the first term pushes the frequency of excitations $\omega$ over $1/a$.

Another soloution to heavy quarks is to replace the relativistic fermion action e.g. HISQ, with a lattice version of NRQCD \cite{Lepage:1992tx}. In NRQCD the $b$ has no rest mass.

%% The leading order Lagrangian in the continuum is
%% \begin{align}
%%   \mathscr{L}^0_{NRQCD} = \psi^{\dagger}_+ \left[ i\partial_0 + {{\bf{\nabla}}^2\over 2m_b} \right] \psi_+.
%% \end{align}
%% $\psi_+$ is the first two components of a Dirac spinor, the second two components (the antiparticle) are not present since the dispersion relation from this Lagrangian has no antiparticle solutions.
%% $m_b$ is the bare mass for the $b$ quark. The NRQCD action reproduces \eqref{eq:rel_expansion} with the first term chopped out.

%% Correction terms are chosen to be all gauge-invariant terms, grouped according to powers of the quark velocity $v$. For an example of deducing such powers: kinetic enegry = $m_b v^2 = \int d^3x \psi_+^{\dagger} {\bf{\nabla}^2\over 2m_b} \psi_+$ $\rightarrow$ $|\bf{\nabla}|/m_b \sim v$.

Annother benefit of NRQCD is that it does not suffer from a doubling problem, since the doubling problem is a purely relativistic issue (the doubling symmetry requires 4 component spinors for $\gamma$ matrices to act on.

The lattice calculations we perform require us to compute propagators for $b$ quarks on fixed gauge backgrounds. The form of the action allows propagators $M^{-1}[U]$ to be computed using a simple recursion relation
\begin{align}
  M_b^{-1}({\textbf{x}},t+1)[U] = e^{-aH}[U] M^{-1}_b({\textbf{x}},t)[U]
\end{align}
which is numerically very fast. In the interest of numerical stability, the time evolution operator is re-cast as
\begin{align}
  e^{-aH} = \left(1 - {a\delta H\over 2}\right)\left(1-{aH_0\over 2 n}\right)^n U_0^{\dagger}({\textbf{x}},t) \left(1 - {aH_0\over 2n}\right)^n \left(1-{a\delta H\over 2}\right)
\end{align}
where $n$ is an arbitrary integer (chosen in our studies to be $n=4$), and the Hamiltonian has been broken up into a leading part $H_0$ and correction $\delta H$. We use the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s v^4)$ corrected NRQCD Hamiltionian:
\begin{align}
  aH_0 =& - {\nabla^{(2)}\over 2am_b} , \\
  \nonumber
  a\delta H =& - c_1 {(\nabla^{(2)})^2 \over 8 (am_b)^3} + c_2{ i\over 8(am_b)^2} ( \nabla\cdot {\bf{\tilde{E}}} - {\bf{\tilde{E}}}\cdot \nabla) \\
  \nonumber
  & - c_3 {1\over 8(am_b)^2} \sigma\cdot ( \nabla\times{\bf{\tilde{E}}} - {\bf{\tilde{E}}}\times\nabla) \\
  \nonumber
  & - c_4 {1\over 2am_b} \sigma\cdot {\bf{\tilde{B}}} + c_5 {\nabla^{(4)}\over 24 am_b} \\
  & - c_6 {(\nabla^{(2)})^2\over 16n (am_b)^2}
\end{align}
where $\nabla^{(2,4)}$ are the second and fourth lattice derivative, ${\bf{\tilde{E}}}$ and ${\bf{\tilde{B}}}$ are the (Symmanzik improved) chromoelectric and chromomagnetic fields. The form of $\nabla^{(2,4)}$,${\bf{\tilde{E}}},{\bf{\tilde{B}}}$ are defined in sec. 4.2 of \cite{Lepage:1992tx}, and were improved upon in \cite{Gray:2005ur}.

The coefficients $\{c_i\}$ have been fixed via various calculations adopting a number of methods. The coefficients of the kinetic terms, $c_{1,5,6}$, were most recently fixed by comparing the lattice NRQCD dispersion relation to that of the continuum in perturbation theory \cite{Davies:2018fwg}. $c_2$ is a spin-independent term which can effect radial and orbital excitation energies, is not expected to have as large an effect as the kinetic terms, so is set to it's tree-level value of 1. The result of varying $c_2$ on relevant observables was investigated in sec. IIIC of \cite{Dowdall:2011wh}, and the effects were very small. $c_3$ and $c_4$ are spin-dependent terms, which would have a small effect on spin-averaged observables (i.e. all observables computed in this work). $c_3$ is set to 1, and $c_4$ is tuned non-perturbatively, by matching predictions of the fine structure of the $\Upsilon$ spectrum from lattice NRQCD to experiment \cite{Dowdall:2011wh}.

Once the propagator for the 2-component non-relativistic $b$ quark has been found, it must be transformed back into a 4-component spinor. This is done by the inverse Fouldy-Wouthuysen transformation \cite{PhysRev.78.29}:
\begin{align}
  \psi(x) = e^{-{{\bf{\gamma}}\cdot{\bf{\nabla}}\over 2m_b}}\binom{\psi_+(x)}{0}.
  \label{eq:FoldyWoldy}
\end{align}
