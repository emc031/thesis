\chapter{$b$-Physics from Lattice NRQCD}

\section{$B_{(s)}\to D_{(s)} l\nu$ Form Factors}
\label{chap:NRQCDformfactors}

{\red{

    breif motivation

    disclaimer: this was never properly finished!
    (is it ok to say this?)

}}

\subsection{Calculation Setup}

{\red{

    ensemble details, what correlators were calculated, etc.

}}

\subsection{Results}

{\red{

    as far as I got : plots of form factors

    discuss how too many correlators makes the fits very unstable...

}}

\subsection{The Subleading Current Problem}

{\red{

    Talk about the fact that $J^{(3,4)}_k$ are huge, how there isn't much way around this
    
}}
\section{Nonperturbative Renormalisation}
\label{chap:NRQCDnorms}

\subsection{Relativistic Normalisation of the $b\to c$ Axial Current}

{\red{

    brief description of what we were trying to do: test normalisations, or fix new normalisations

    results - plots of $a_0(p)/a_0(0)$ against $p^2$

    why it didn't work

}}

\subsection{$b\to c$ Vector Current Matching to Heavy-HISQ} 

{\red{

    Explain that $B_c\to \eta_c$ data from both heavy-HISQ and NRQCD were avaliable, ref. Andrew \& Brian.

    Fix normalisation of $V_0$ by comparing $f_0/f_{B_c}$ at zero recoil at $q^2=0$.
