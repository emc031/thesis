\section*{Acknowledgments}

I would like to thank my supervisor, Christine Davies, for her guidance and patience as I stumbled through this PhD making every possible mistake along the way. 

I also owe a debt of gratitude to Brian Colquhoun and Andrew Lytle, who's advice and support in the opening stages of my time in Glasgow were indispensible. Without you I surely would have perished. You are top humans.

I would also like to thank Jonna Koponen, Chris Bouchard, Dan Hatton and Javad Komijani for an array of very useful conversations. I hope the Lattice [continues to] treat you well.

It also seems traditional to acknowledge the other students in the group, for like friendship or something. They were ok I guess.
